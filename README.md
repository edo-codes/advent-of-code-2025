# Advent of Code 2025 in Rust

To run a solution:

```sh
# E.g. day 1, part 1
cargo run -- 1a
```

Or to run the latest implemented solution:

```sh
cargo run
```

To test a solution on the example in the problem:

```sh
# E.g. day 1, part 1
cargo test day1::tests::test_a
```

Don't forget to update `PROBLEMS` in `main.rs` when adding new days.
